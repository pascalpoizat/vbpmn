VBPMN - Verification of BPMN
==============================
The goal of VBPMN is to provide formal modelling and automated 
analysis techniques for ensuring correctness, efficiency, 
and quality of the whole business process execution. 

VBPMN provides a web interface where process designers can upload
BPMN 2.0 models and compare them using various comparison modes. 
The interface provides instant feedback through counter examples and 
helps users correct and refine their models.

Usage
===============================
VBPMN web app is available for download as a web archive (WAR). 
Hosting of the web app requires [Apache Tomcat 8.0](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi). 

[**Download VBPMN**](https://pascalpoizat.github.io/vbpmn-web/downloads/transformation.war) 

Once you have the web app running, you can access the application 
using the following web page (assuming tomcat is running locally on port 8080)

http://localhost:8080/transformation 

If you need sample BPMN 2.0 models to try, you can download it from the site
